Title:
A Comparative Study Using Statistical and Machine Learning Modeling Techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVR, and ANN on the Diabetes Dataset

Description:
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook used to predict diabetes progression values based on the Diabetes dataset from Scikit-Learn.
The notebook includes the following stages: data loading, data exploration, preprocessing, splitting data into training & testing sets, building and training regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Support Vector Regression, and Artificial Neural Network), model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and R² metrics, and visualization of prediction results to compare each model’s performance.

Key Features:
Implementation of 4 regression methods.

Scatter plot and multi-model prediction line visualization.

Model evaluation with comprehensive error metrics.
